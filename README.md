# English to Bangla Translator

The goal of this project is to create an English-to-Bangla character translator using Prolog. The
project addresses the practical problem of transliterating English (phonetic) text into Bangla
characters based on the Avro phonetic keyboard layout. This system is intended to help users write
Bangla text using English letters as input, which is a common approach in digital communication in
Bangladesh.
